3. **Process** – Cleaned data, removed duplicates, converted dates, merged datasets.  
4. **Analyze** – Identified trends by weekday, hour, and activity intensity.  
5. **Share** – Created Tableau dashboard and summarized insights.

## 📊 Summary 
**Business Task and guiding Questions**
The goal of this analysis is to identify trends in smart device usage using publicly available FitBit fitness tracker data.
By understanding how users track their daily activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure, we aim to uncover patterns that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy

**Some questions that could be answered with the data could be:**

1.  When are users most active during the day or week?
2.  How much sleep do users get, and when?
3. What’s the relationship between steps, calories, activity level, and sleep?
4. Are users more active on weekdays or weekends?
5. What times or habits correlate with better consistency?
6. What are the seasonal or monthly activity trends?

**These questions could help us with our marketing strategy in the following way:**

1. Send motivational app notifications before high-activity hours. Schedule social media posts or email campaigns during users’ most active hours.
2. Promote sleep-related products (like the "Leaf" product).
3. Design targeted campaigns for each profile: motivational messages for low-activity users, mindfulness content for sleep-deprived users, or performance-focused challenges for high-activity users.
4. Tailor marketing campaigns for weekends and weekdays.
5. Reward consistent users with loyalty badges; send reminders to less consistent users to re-engage them with Bellabeat’s app or membership program.
6. Seasonal Campaigns—Launch “Winter Wellness” programs or discounts during low-activity months. Promote app challenges in spring/summer when users are more active.
